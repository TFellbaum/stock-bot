# Stock Bot

## About
January 2021 saw rise to new stock market investors of all kinds as the popular subreddit r/WallStreetBets took on an interest in highly shorted stocks like GameStop, AMC Theatres and BlackBerry. A group of us had invested in $GME and were anxiously updating each other on the stock price roller coaster. Someone suggested we build a custom bot to track and post for us. And thus..., Stock Bot was born.
